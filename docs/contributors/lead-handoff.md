# Lead handoff (state on 30.10.2026)

Read this first when a new lead session (Claude) takes over. Everything else lives in GitHub: issues, PRs, reviews.
`CLAUDE.md` (the lead's rules), `AGENTS.md` (contributors' rules, which apply to the lead too) and
`docs/contributors/lessons.md` (review cases) are the rules; this file is only the state and the habits.

## People and roles

- **Owner:** Yurii. Writes in Russian; a message in Latin letters is often Russian typed on the English layout
  ("lfdfq" = "давай", "jr" = "ок").
- **Lead and reviewer:** Claude. Branch prefix `claude/`, migration suffix `_1`, label `claude`.
- **Contributors:**

  | Who | Label and branch prefix | Migration suffix |
  |---|---|---|
  | Codex | `codex` | `_2` |
  | Second Claude | `claude2` | `_5` |

  Suffixes `_3` and `_4` belonged to former contributors and are never reused.
- Contributors are called by `@codex` in an issue or PR comment, or simply take open issues with their label
  (`scripts/wait-for-work.sh <label>`).

## Work in flight

Audit of 30.10.2026: `docs/status/2026-10-30-server-audit.md` (what is left on the server and in which issue).

| Who | Queue (in order) |
|---|---|
| Codex | #130 (retention, approved; resolving the conflict with `main`) → #124 → #136 web foundation → #140 payments → #142 admin orders → #144 privacy |
| Second Claude | #135 documents encrypted at rest (E6 after #130) → #137 rider app → #141 driver states → #143 operator and driver |
| Lead | merges in migration order, reviews, #139 API conventions → #145 operations → #146 pilot proofs |

Owner to confirm (in the audit doc): road-ETA dispatch, call queues, bulk operations, webhook path, WayForPay sandbox keys.
Merging: `.claude/settings.json` on `main` allows the lead's squash merge; the hourly scheduled check reviews contributors and reports idleness.

### Reminders (no work now)

- #30 admin panel for tariffs and finance.
- #43 own GraphHopper server.
- #46 payment link by SMS.

### Open owner questions

Q-05, 06, 07, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18 are still open in the specification; never treat them as decided.

## How the lead works

1. **Review each contributor PR in order:** scope, specification, invariants, tests, CI.
   - Re-check the evidence yourself: run their script, a stricter probe, or a spot check of payloads against schemas.
   - Post the review with event `COMMENT`; `REQUEST_CHANGES` is impossible on the same account.
   - Then squash-merge with `gh api -X PUT repos/feraltraffic-alt/blizz.taxi/pulls/N/merge -f merge_method=squash`.
2. **Own work** goes through a `claude/` branch and a PR. Merge only after CI and a full sandbox are green on the last commit:
   - start the sandbox with `gh workflow run sandbox.yml --ref <branch> -f scenario=all`;
   - read the results on branch `sandbox-runs`, in `runs/<run id>/results.txt`.

   Docs-only changes may go straight to `main`.
   - In auto mode the session's permission check refuses `gh api -X PUT .../pulls/N/merge` as a merge without
     review, even after the lead's review is posted: ask the owner, or the owner adds a permission rule.
3. **After merging several PRs**, run the full sandbox on `main` once more.
4. **After a review with findings,** add a case to `lessons.md` and the habit to `AGENTS.md`.

### Tools and limits of the lead's environment

- GitHub GraphQL is blocked: use REST through `gh api`, PR creation included
  (`gh api repos/.../pulls -f base=main -f head=... -f title=... -F body=@file`).
- CI errors are read through `gh api repos/.../check-runs/<job id>/annotations`.
- Maven Central is not reachable from the lead's container, so the server cannot be built locally: CI is the compiler.
  Small pure-Java checks can run with a downloaded JDK (`javac` on single files).
- Never force-push, never rewrite `main`, no secrets in the repository.
- The owner's e-mail is used only for authorship.

## Recent history (29–30.10.2026)

- **#126 (lead):** OTP budget per range of numbers (`blizz.otp.max-per-range-per-hour`, 500); the tests and the
  sandbox raise it in their own config.
- **Full code audit:** #113 to #117, then #119 to #122. Lessons 10 and 11.
- **Codex:** #109 reconciliation, #123 contract drift audit (`scripts/audit/contract-drift.mjs`), #125 hot-path
  indexes and background debt refresh.
- **Main** is green after each round, CI and the full sandbox.
